/**
 * FurnitureBase represents an individual furniture item within the FurnitureStore system.
 * Each FurnitureBase has a unique ID, a description detailing its characteristics, 
 * a type or category (like chair, table, bed), materials used, dimensions, 
 * and a price. The store's inventory is essentially a collection of FurnitureBase objects.
 * The system relies on the comprehensive data within each FurnitureBase 
 * to manage stock levels, make sales transactions, and provide detailed 
 * product information to both staff and customers. Properly maintained 
 * FurnitureBase records ensure that the store can track product availability, 
 * popularity, and sales trends over time.

/**
 * FurnitureCategory denotes a specific category or type within the FurnitureStore system.
 * Each category is distinct, such as chairs, tables, beds, or sofas. Every FurnitureCategory 
 * has a unique name, a general description outlining its features, and potentially other 
 * attributes like average price range, typical materials used, or general care instructions.
 * This categorization helps both the store's staff and customers in sorting, identifying, 
 * and narrowing down their product searches. It streamlines inventory management by 
 * grouping similar items, facilitating bulk operations, and assisting in sales analytics.
 * The FurnitureCategory also aids in promotional activities, allowing for category-wide 
 * discounts or special deals.

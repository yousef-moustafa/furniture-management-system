PROJECT TITLE: Furniture Management System (FMS)

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This project aims to design and implement a comprehensive furniture management system that caters to
different categories of furniture. The software will keep track of the inventory, details of each furniture
piece, purchasing information, and customers' details.

● The FurnitureBase Class provides a generic template for different furniture items.
● The Purchaser Class focuses on the details of customers, capturing essential information and their 
purchase history.
● The FurnitureCategory Class is concerned with classifying furniture into distinct categories based 
on specific criteria like their materials and suitability for different environments.
● OfficeFurniture and KidsSet classes cater to specialized furniture categories, each having its unique 
attributes and features, thereby enhancing the diversity of the furniture items the system can manage
